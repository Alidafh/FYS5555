# FYS5555 - Project 3

# To run code:

Open 'run.py' and update the path to the data location in the main part of the program,

my_path = 'path/to/data/GamGam/'

Execute with the command:

'python run.py'

You can choose between running only for real data-0, only monte carlo-1,
or running for both-2. New folders called 'output/datafiles' and 'output/plots'
will be created. If these already exists, the following is prompted:

'directory /output already exists, continue with the same folder [y/n]'

Type 'y' if you want to use the existing folders and 'n' to abort.
